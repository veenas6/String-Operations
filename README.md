# String Manipulation in C

## Overview
This C program performs several common string operations including reversing a string, checking if a string is a palindrome (ignoring case and spaces), concatenating two strings, and counting the number of words in a string.

## Features
- **Reverse a string:** Reverses the input string in-place.
- **Palindrome check:** Checks if the input string is a palindrome, ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters.
- **String concatenation:** Concatenates one string to the end of another.
- **Word count:** Counts the number of words in a string.

## How It Works
The program interacts with the user through the console, performing the following tasks one by one:
1. Takes a string input and prints its reverse.
2. Takes a string input and checks whether it is a palindrome.
3. Takes two strings and concatenates the second to the first.
4. Takes a string and counts the number of words.

## Usage

### Compile the program
```bash
gcc -o string_manipulation string_manipulation.c
